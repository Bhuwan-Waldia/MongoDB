# MongoDB
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas




MongoDB name is derived from the word "Humongous" which means huge, enormous. MongoDB database is built to store a huge amount of data and also perform fast.

MongoDB is not a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). It's called a "NoSQL" database. It is opposite to SQL based databases where it does not normalize data under schemas and tables where every table has a fixed structure. Instead, it stores data in the collections as JSON based documents and does not enforce schemas. It does not have tables, rows, and columns as other SQL (RDBMS) databases.



Advantages of MongoDB
MongoDB stores data as JSON based document that does not enforce the schema. It allows us to store hierarchical data in a document. This makes it easy to store and retrieve data in an efficient manner.
It is easy to scale up or down as per the requirement since it is a document based database. MongoDB also allows us to split data across multiple servers.
MongoDB provides rich features like indexing, aggregation, file store, etc.
MongoDB performs fast with huge data.
MongoDB provides drivers to store and fetch data from different applications developed in different technologies such as C#, Java, Python, Node.js, etc.
MongoDB provides tools to manage MongoDB databases.
