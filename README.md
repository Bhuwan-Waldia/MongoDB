# MongoDB

When dealing with data, there are two types of data as we know â€“ (i) structured data and (ii) unstructured data. Structured data is usually stored in a tabular form whereas unstructured data is not. To manage huge sets of unstructured data like log or IoT data, a NoSQL database is used.

What is MongoDB ?

MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL database written in C++ language. It uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

It provides easy scalability and is a cross-platform, document-oriented database.

MongoDB works on the concept of Collection and Document.

It combines the ability to scale out with features such as secondary indexes, range queries, sorting, aggregations, and geospatial indexes.

MongoDB name is derived from the word "Humongous" which means huge, enormous. MongoDB database is built to store a huge amount of data and also perform fast.

MongoDB is not a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). It's called a "NoSQL" database. It is opposite to SQL based databases where it does not normalize data under schemas and tables where every table has a fixed structure. Instead, it stores data in the collections as JSON based documents and does not enforce schemas. It does not have tables, rows, and columns as other SQL (RDBMS) databases.



Advantages of MongoDB

MongoDB stores data as JSON based document that does not enforce the schema. It allows us to store hierarchical data in a document. This makes it easy to store and retrieve data in an efficient manner.

It is easy to scale up or down as per the requirement since it is a document based database. MongoDB also allows us to split data across multiple servers.

MongoDB provides rich features like indexing, aggregation, file store, etc.

MongoDB performs fast with huge data.

MongoDB provides drivers to store and fetch data from different applications developed in different technologies such as C#, Java, Python, Node.js, etc.

MongoDB provides tools to manage MongoDB databases.
