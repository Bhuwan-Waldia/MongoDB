# MongoDB
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas




MongoDB name is derived from the word "Humongous" which means huge, enormous. MongoDB database is built to store a huge amount of data and also perform fast.

MongoDB is not a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). It's called a "NoSQL" database. It is opposite to SQL based databases where it does not normalize data under schemas and tables where every table has a fixed structure. Instead, it stores data in the collections as JSON based documents and does not enforce schemas. It does not have tables, rows, and columns as other SQL (RDBMS) databases.
